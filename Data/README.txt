Abstract
SensSmartTech database comprises cardiovascular signals synchronously recorded by electrocardiograph (ECG), phonocardiograph (PCG), photoplethysmograph (PPG) and accelerometer (ACC) at various heart rates (HRs). It is composed of 338 30-s multiparameter recordings taken from 32 healthy volunteers. Recordings contain information from 10 channels: 4 ECG (limb, V3 and V4 leads), 1 PCG (measured at heart apex), 4 PPG (measured at carotid and brachial arteries at two light frequencies each) and 1 ACC (measured between V3 and V4 ECG electrodes).
The signals are offered in two formats: WFDB (WaveForm DataBase) and CSV (comma-separated-value). CSV files contain original sensor acquisition times and recordings (save the filtering described below). WFDB files contain recordings resampled to 1 kHz onto a common time axis.

Usage Notes
The ECG signals are filtered by a low-pass filter with a 150 Hz cut-off. The powerline interference at 50 Hz and its 2nd and 3rd harmonics are eliminated using zero-phase notch filters. The mean value of each PPG signal was set to zero. The data are otherwise left unprocessed and are presented as originally recorded.
